> **Abstract:** In their work, [Dean, Rich, and Recht](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10068.pdf) create a model to research *recourse* and *availability* of items in a recommender system. We used the definition of *predictive multiplicity* by [Marx, Pin Calmon, and Ustun](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06677.pdf) to examine different variations of this model, using different values for two model parameters. Pairwise comparison of their models show, that most of these models produce very similar results in terms of discrepancy and ambiguity for the *availability* and only in some cases the availability sets differ significantly.
